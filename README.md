## Project Overview

This project consists of three core analyses:
1. **Income Prediction**: Using machine learning classifiers like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest to predict income levels based on demographic data.
2. **Financial Patterns Analysis**: Using K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering to analyze financial datasets and uncover meaningful patterns.
3. **Hotel Rating Prediction**: Applying Text Mining and Sentiment Analysis to predict hotel ratings based on customer reviews.

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand and visualize the dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing** to clean and prepare the data for analysis.
- **Classification Models**: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest for income prediction.
- **Clustering**: K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering to group financial data.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Text mining techniques to analyze customer reviews and predict ratings.
- **Implementation in Azure**: Experimented with models using Azure Machine Learning Designer for scalable machine learning workflows.

## Dataset

The datasets used in this project are publicly available datasets:
- **Income Prediction**: A demographic dataset with various factors such as age, education, occupation, etc.
- **Financial Patterns**: A dataset with financial indicators such as savings, investments, and income.
- **Hotel Reviews**: A collection of customer reviews for hotel stays, including text reviews and ratings.

## Models and Algorithms

- **Classification Models**: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest
- **Clustering**: K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering
- **Text Mining and Sentiment Analysis**: Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze hotel reviews.
- **Azure Machine Learning Designer**: Used for implementing and experimenting with machine learning models in a scalable environment.

## Results

- **Income Prediction**: Achieved a high accuracy rate with Random Forest compared to KNN.
- **Financial Clustering**: Identified distinct customer segments based on financial indicators.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Accurately predicted hotel ratings based on the sentiment extracted from customer reviews.
